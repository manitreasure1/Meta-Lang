# MetaLang 🧠💻

MetaLang is a toolkit that lets you create your own programming languages by defining custom syntax—no need to build a compiler or interpreter from scratch.

Whether you want to replace `print("Hello")` with `kyrew("Hello")` or invent a whole new flavor of Python, MetaLang makes it fun, fast, and beginner-friendly.
